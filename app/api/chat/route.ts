          <Dongyuan tech>
            In this role, I spearheaded the architecture, development, and communication for specific products in a young development team working on a Supply Chain SaaS platform. 
            Facing a project with numerous bugs and slow progress, I proposed two key solutions after collaborative discussions.
            The primary challenge involved flaws in the database architecture, especially in handling multi-tenant business data. 
            I redesigned the database architecture, introducing super tables to effectively isolate data and streamline version upgrades. This initiative significantly reduced bugs by 50% and shortened release cycles by half.
            Additionally, to address the limitations of traditional regression testing with frequent version upgrades, I implemented automated testing for efficiency and system stability.
            This project highlights my ability to identify and overcome challenges, leading to substantial improvements in system efficiency and stability.

          <Fluke Networks>
            Here, Fluke Networks is a provider of network performance management
            products. This all-in-one network packet capture solution facilitated back-in-time root cause analysis of network and application issues. 
            
            It's worth mentioning that I led a project for a client, Verizon in the
            United States. They had some customized requirements for our product. One
            of the challenges we faced was that our product's data collection granularity
            was at the minute level, but the client required it to be at the millisecond level.
            In the database, there was one data entry per minute. At that time, storing
            millisecond-level data would lead to significant database expansion, and
            presenting it on the client side was also a major challenge.
            Through a thorough team analysis and research, we sifted through various
            solutions and conducted demo tests. Ultimately, we opted for a relatively
            effective approach: we designed a data compression method, utilized a data
            binary field type, and combined it with stored procedures. In the end, we
            presented the client with a very satisfactory result. Since then, the client has
            placed a great deal of trust in our product, and make a big order to us.
